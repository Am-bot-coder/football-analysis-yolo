# ⚽ Football Goal Analysis — YOLOv8 Player & Referee Tracker

A computer vision pipeline that detects and tracks **players**, **referees**, and the **ball** in football match footage using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model and ByteTrack multi-object tracking.

## 📽️ Demo

### Before Annotation (Raw Input)

<video src="input_videos/08fd33_4.mp4" controls width="700"></video>

*Original football match footage used as input for detection and tracking.*

---

### After Annotation (Model Output)

<video src="output_videos/output.mp4" controls width="700"></video>

*Annotated output showing tracked players, referees, and object IDs.*

> ⚠️ For best GitHub playback, use `.mp4` instead of `.avi`.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Video Reading
The input match video is read frame-by-frame using OpenCV via `read_video()` in `utils/video_utils.py`.

### 2. Object Detection (YOLOv8)
A custom YOLOv8 model (`models/best.pt`) — fine-tuned on a football players dataset from Roboflow — runs inference on batches of 20 frames at a time with a confidence threshold of `0.2`.

The model detects three classes:
- `player`
- `goalkeeper` (remapped → `player`)
- `referee`
- `ball`

### 3. Multi-Object Tracking (ByteTrack)
Detections are passed to **ByteTrack** (via the `supervision` library) which assigns persistent track IDs to each detected object across frames, even through occlusions.

### 4. Annotation & Visualization
Each frame is annotated with:
- **Ellipses** drawn at the feet of players and referees (mimicking a shadow/ground effect)
- **Track ID labels** in a small rectangle beneath each player
- **Color coding:** Players → Red `(0,0,255)` · Referees → Yellow `(0,255,255)`

### 5. Stub Caching
To avoid re-running inference every time, tracking results are serialized to `stubs/tracks.pkl`. Set `read_from_stub=True` in `main.py` to load cached results instantly.

### 6. Video Export
Annotated frames are saved back as a video using `save_video()`.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The model was trained on the **Football Players Detection** dataset sourced from [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com), organized as:

| Split | Images |
|-------|--------|
| Train | ~280   |
| Valid | ~39    |
| Test  | ~13    |

Training was done using a YOLOv5/v8 notebook (`Training/football_training_yolo_v5.ipynb`).

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install ultralytics supervision opencv-python
```

### Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

To re-run inference (ignoring cached stubs), set `read_from_stub=False` in `main.py`:

```python
tracks = tracker.get_object_tracks(video_frames, read_from_stub=False)
```

## 📌 Key Files Explained

### `main.py`
The entry point. Reads the video, initializes the tracker with the custom model, retrieves object tracks (from stub or fresh inference), draws annotations, and saves the output.

### `tracker/tracker.py`
The core `Tracker` class containing:
- `detect_frames()` — batched YOLOv8 inference
- `get_object_tracks()` — converts detections to tracked objects with persistent IDs
- `draw_ellipse()` — draws the ellipse + ID badge for each tracked entity
- `draw_annotations()` — applies annotations across all frames

### `utils/bbox_utils.py`
Helper functions: `get_centre_of_bbox()` and `get_width_bbox()` used to compute ellipse placement from bounding box coordinates.
